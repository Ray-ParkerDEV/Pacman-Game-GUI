## Project name
### GAME PACMAN

## Description
  In this project, I have created a demo version of the game Pacman. The game has a convenient logic to create different versions of labyrinths for displaying in GUI. It was an internal learning project of my program on the IT Education Academy. The main goal of the project is to learn how to create a graphical interface. Also i had the opportunity to use music decoration for my game, in order to give some style and fun for the game.
  During game development, I used JFrame to display the graphical interface. Also, I hooked up the user action listener - for the keyboard. I implemented the ability to create in the form of a matrix of new levels and labyrinths and connected music.
I have implemented ActionListener, KeyListener for listening to the keyboard and paintComponent method for placing the images objects onto the frame. The music is played by AudioInputStream which reads the loaded music file in Wav format.

Tools - Eclipse, VCS Git.
Technologies	Java 8, JFrame.
